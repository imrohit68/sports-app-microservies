<p id="description">This project isn't your average monolithic beast. It's a microservice masterpiece meticulously crafted with Spring Boot technologies. Imagine independent containerized features waltzing across environments guided by Spring Cloud Eureka's baton. Keycloak and OAuth 2.0 stand guard ensuring security with industry-standard authorization. But the magic doesn't stop there. Resilience4j shields your services from failures while Loki and Prometheus illuminate system health and performance. Tempo your tracing maestro untangles request flows and RabbitMQ with Spring Cloud Function orchestrates the event-driven magic. The result? Scalability that glides resilience that endures and observability that shines.</p>
